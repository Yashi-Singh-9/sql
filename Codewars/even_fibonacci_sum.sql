-- Instructions

-- Give the summation of all even numbers in a Fibonacci sequence up to, but not including, the number passed to your function. Or, in other words, sum all the even Fibonacci numbers that are lower than the given number n (n is not the nth element of Fibonacci sequence) without including n.

-- The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next value is the addition of the previous two values. The series starts with 0 and 1:

-- 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

-- For example:

-- Kata.Fibonacci(0) // returns 0
-- Kata.Fibonacci(33) // returns 10
-- Kata.Fibonacci(25997544) // returns 19544084
